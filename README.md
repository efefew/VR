# VR
In this game, you have to draw with your right index finger (I specifically set this as my task). You can click on the buttons in the UI to save and upload the latest drawing (there is no point in the list of saved drawings, since this is a training project). There are buttons to clear the picture and change the color to red and blue.

## About

I have studied the metaXR package for VR:
* passthrough mode
* tracking the movement of fingers and controllers
* working with UI in VR
